# Siva Chidambaram

VLSI Engineer with a deep interest in computing systems, operating systems and kernels, computer architecture, and scripting. My academic foundation in electrical engineering supports a strong inclination toward semiconductor validation, EDA tools, and automated test equipment. Currently working as a Silicon Validation Engineer with experience in test program development, validation, and optimization across various stages of SoC testing.

## Professional Overview
In parallel with a focus on hardware engineering, I actively explore frontend development, UI/UX design, and static site generation. This crossover allows me to build clean wireframes, content-first interfaces, and brand consulting tools, while leveraging a solid foundation in algorithm design, problem-solving, root cause analysis (RCA), and debugging. I have gained experience with serverless frameworks, full-stack development, and project deployment, along with practical skills in UI/UX design tools like Adobe XD and Figma. My technical skills also include software engineering, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and data-driven design, which enable me to create seamless, user-centric experiences.

Alongside my engineering roles, I contribute to family business operations in key management capacities. These experiences have strengthened my skill set in project management, agile methodologies, and cross-functional collaboration.
