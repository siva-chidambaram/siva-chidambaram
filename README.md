# Siva Chidambaram

## About Me
I am a VLSI Engineer based in Bengaluru with a deep interest in computing systems, operating systems and kernels, computer architecture, and scripting. My academic foundation in electrical engineering supports a strong inclination toward semiconductor validation, EDA toolchains, and test equipment.

## Technical Scope
In parallel with my hardware focus, I actively explore frontend development, UI/UX design, and static site generation. This crossover allows me to build clean wireframes, content-first interfaces, and brand consulting tools.

## Professional Roles
Alongside my engineering roles, I contribute to family business operations in key management capacities. These experiences have strengthened my skill set in project management, agile methodologies, and cross-functional collaboration.
